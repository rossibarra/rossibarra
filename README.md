### Howdy!

I'm currently working on estimating recent demography in [maize](https://github.com/rossibarra/ibd_maize) (and maybe some other crops if I can get things working. Check out other ongoings at the [lab webpage](www.rilab.org) or the [lab github](https://github.com/RILAB) including for example ideas on how to [use your \<censored\> bp](https://github.com/RILAB/invariant_sites_workflow).

You can also find me [twittering around](https://twitter.com/jrossibarra). But I'm not a cool cow from 1994,  and I won't tell you what [R.E.H.A.B.](www.rilab.org/rehab.html) stands for, so don't ask.
